## Prerequisites

1. Bash Scripting
2. [JQ](https://gist.github.com/olih/f7437fb6962fb3ee9fe95bda8d2c8fa4)

## Pros

1. Multiple clusters can configured locally in an automated way
2. If your local configuration is messed up (Which I do often :P), it is easy to fix it.

## Manual Way?

To setup a cluster locally, the cluster context needs to be added in your machine.

```sh
az aks get-credentials -n ${name} -g ${resource_group} # Setting the Kube Context
```

> Running the above cmd for every cluster can be cumbersome. Let's automate it!!

## CODE

Let's jump into the solution right away.

1. First, try to create a json file that acts as the input for our script.

```json
{
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  },
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  },
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  },
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  },
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  },
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  },
  <Subscription-ID>: {
    region: <region>,
    name: <cluster  name>,
    resource_group: <Resource Group Name>
  }
}
```

2. Read the data from the input JSON file created at the previous step using the JQ cmd and fetch the list of subscription IDs.

```sh
# Getting the list of subscriptoin IDs
subscription_ids=$(echo ${data} | jq -r 'keys | .[]')
```

3. Let's loop the list of subscription IDs and update the kube context for every cluster

```sh
echo ${subscription_ids} | while read -r subscription_id; do
    echo Setting the AZ Context for the Current Sub ID: ${subscription_id}
    az account set -s ${subscription_id} # Setting the Az Context

    name=$(echo ${data} | jq -re '.'\$subscription_id\'.'name'') # Fetching the Name of the Cluster
    resource_group=$(echo ${data} | jq -re '.'\$subscription_id\'.'resource_group'') # Fetching the name of the resource group
    echo Getting the aks credentials for the cluster : ${name} in the rg: ${resource_group}
    az aks get-credentials -n ${name} -g ${resource_group} # Setting the Kube Context
done
```

The whole code looks like something below.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Getting the Cluster Info from the local Json
data=$(cat <./data/cluster_info.json | jq -r)

# Getting the list of subscriptoin IDs
subscription_ids=$(echo ${data} | jq -r 'keys | .[]')
echo ${subscription_ids} | while read -r subscription_id; do
    echo Setting the AZ Context for the Current Sub ID: ${subscription_id}
    az account set -s ${subscription_id} # Setting the Az Context

    name=$(echo ${data} | jq -re '.'\$subscription_id\'.'name'') # Fetching the Name of the Cluster
    resource_group=$(echo ${data} | jq -re '.'\$subscription_id\'.'resource_group'') # Fetching the name of the resource group
    echo Getting the aks credentials for the cluster : ${name} in the rg: ${resource_group}
    az aks get-credentials -n ${name} -g ${resource_group} # Setting the Kube Context
done

```
